To get quickly started:

1. Drag the "Gizmos" folder to your project root.

2. Check out the example scenes to see some ways these assets can be used (and read and follow the note in that folder!)

3. Dig into the prefab folder and its subfolders to see all the assets available to you.

4. Take advantage of material swapping and environmental blending by opening the CaveDungeonFunctions window, located at Window > CW3 > CaveDungeonToolkit
